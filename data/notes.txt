This memory usage is not exposed anywhere. 

Note that it is only a very very gross approximation, it doesn't take into account lots of things
that are allocated for glTF (and X3D nodes underneath). It's only an approximation, to basically 
warn you --- some glTF skinned animations indeed eat a lot of memory in CGE now, due to the way we
handle skinned animations.

( Why? We "precalculate" skinned animations at loading. Which eats memory, eats loading time, and
doesn't allow to redesign animation at runtime. The advantage is that it doesn't require doing 
skinned animaton on GPU, so it was simpler to implement and works basically everywhere. It will 
be absolutely definitely improved at some point -- everyone else uses now GPU skinning which avoids 
these problems. Note that support for glTF skinned animations on ancient GPUs (without shaders) may 
then get deprecated and eventually disappear. I will warn about it in news, but basically we cannot 
maintain 2 non-trvial implementations of skinned animation in the long-term, so once we jump to GPU 
skinned animation -> we will want to rely on it. )

Getting back to the topic: while the information is not exposed, you can calculate it yourself. 
Use TX3DNode.EnumerateNodes to find all instances of TCoordinateInterpolatorNode nodes. 
For each TCoordinateInterpolatorNode, add 
MemoryTaken += MyInterpolator.FdKeyValue.Items.Capacity * SizeOf(TVector3); . 
You can use node names (MyInterpolator.X3DName) to split this information  per-animation.
========================
@michalis Another Q I've asked before :(...
How do I get at the list of interpolations used to animate some chosen animation? In Blender this would 
be the Animation Timeline
The thing is that some Take 001 animations have lists using frame numbers but if the last animation is 
quoted as a starting frame and the end frame number is omitted then there's some ambiguity as to timing 
that could potentially affect everything else in that animation.

========================

See how TDetectAffectedFields works in TCastleSceneCore.

It enumerates all ROUTEs that connect TTimeSensorNode (which represents an animation) with an interpolator in TDetectAffectedFields.FindRoutesAndInterpolatorsEnumerate.

It looks at all animations, so it does

if (Route.SourceNode is TTimeSensorNode) and
TTimeSensorNode(Route.SourceNode).DetectAffectedFields then


In your case, if you want to look at specific animation, you would instead just compare 

if (Route.SourceNode is TTimeSensorNode) and
TTimeSensorNode(Route.SourceNode).X3DName = 
'my-animation' then

@michalis This BB function - like this???
{ TCastleSceneHelper }

function TCastleSceneHelper.CalculateFrameBoundingBox: TBox3D;
var
  ShapeList: TShapeList;
  Shape: TShape;
begin
  Result := TBox3D.Empty;
  ShapeList := Shapes.TraverseList(true);
  for Shape in ShapeList do
    Result.Include(Shape.BoundingBox);
end;

function TCastleSceneHelper.FrameBoundingBox: TBox3D;
begin
    Result := CalculateFrameBoundingBox.Transform(Transform);
end;
Basically copies private function from castlescenecore - seems to work
==================

Your FrameBoundingBox shown above will make the same results as just existing MyScene.BoundingBox. 

If you want to get tighter bbox of animation frames, you'd have disable box collision nodes that surround animated mesh, 
see https://castle-engine.io/gltf#_collisions_when_your_gltf_mesh_uses_skinned_animation . 

Remember this is never guaranteed to be "as tight as possible" anyway. This is bounding volume. No guarantees it will be 
as tight as possible.
