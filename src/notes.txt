You can pan the camera in any direction. What each direction means (in local and world space) depends on your setup.

You can e.g.
use Camera.GetWorldView(Pos, Dir, Up) to get Pos, Dir, Up in world coordinates,
calculate then Side := TVector3.CrossProduct(Dir, Up),
and move as need adding X * Side + Y * Up to global position, by Camera.SetWorldView(Pos + X * Side + Y * Up, Dir, Up).
